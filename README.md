<h2 align='center'>Abstract</h2>
<p align='justify'>In the last couple of years, the expression ‘carbon footprint’ has been in use among meteorologist. The usage of the expression is not unconnected with the fact that the challenge of climate change has been one of the topmost issues on political as well as corporate agenda. Therefore, calculations of carbon footprint have been in high demand. Scholars have proposed so many approaches to providing estimates. The methods run from uncomplicated online calculations to other ones like complex life-cycle examination otherwise called input-output-based technique and tools. In spite of its ever-present use, it is clear that the term ‘carbon footprint’ does not have a generally acceptable academic definition. Thus, there is a dearth of clarifications of what ‘carbon footprint’ is in the scientific literature despite the fact that there are several studies or researches on energy as well as ecological economics which should have measured what precisely ‘carbon footprint’. Normally the carbon footprint will be calculated number of people residing in specific region will be average with the number of People in that specific region. A system is being proposed to calculate the exact emissions from homes and industries separately. This approach aims to improve the precision of carbon footprint calculations and enable more targeted efforts to reduce emissions. The existing system has some drawback in calculation which will be eventually average for each footprint in region. A calculation method is being developed to predict accurate results for each carbon emissions outcome. This approach aims to improve the precision of carbon footprint calculations and enable more targeted efforts to reduce emissions.</p>

<h3 align='left'>1.1	About the Project</h3>
<p align='justify'>Over the past two years, the term "carbon footprint" has been used by meteorologists. The use of this phrase is not unrelated to the fact that the challenge of climate change is one of the key issues on the political and business agenda. Therefore, calculating carbon emissions has been in high demand. Researchers have come up with a variety of approaches to providing estimates. Methods range from simple online calculations to others such as complex lifecycle testing aka input-output-based techniques and tools. Despite common usage, it is clear that the term "carbon footprint" does not have a widely accepted academic definition. Therefore, there is a lack of clear explanation of what a “carbon footprint” is in the scientific literature despite the fact that there are several studies or studies on energy as well as ecological economics that should have measured it. What exactly is a “carbon footprint”? Normally carbon emissions will be calculated. The number of people residing in a particular area will average with the number of people in that particular area. A system is being developed to calculate the exact emissions of households and industries separately, which will provide a more accurate picture of the sources of carbon emissions. This approach aims to improve the precision of carbon footprint calculations and enable more targeted efforts to reduce emissions. The current system has a certain drawback in the calculation which will eventually be the average per footprint in the area. A calculation method that predicts the precise outcome for each specific outcome is being considered to improve the accuracy of carbon emissions calculations. Additionally, there are proposals for reusing carbon emissions in various ways that offer utility.</p>
