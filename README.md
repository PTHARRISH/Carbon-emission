# Carbon-emission
<h1>LINEAR APPROXIMATION COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY WITH MULTIVARIANT CORRELATION</h1>
<h2 align='center'>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the last couple of years, the expression ‘carbon footprint’ has been in use among meteorologist. The usage of the expression is not unconnected with the fact that the challenge of climate change has been one of the topmost issues on political as well as corporate agenda. Therefore, calculations of carbon footprint have been in high demand. Scholars have proposed so many approaches to providing estimates. The methods run from uncomplicated online calculations to other ones like complex life-cycle examination otherwise called input-output-based technique and tools. In spite of its ever-present use, it is clear that the term ‘carbon footprint’ does not have a generally acceptable academic definition. Thus, there is a dearth of clarifications of what ‘carbon footprint’ is in the scientific literature despite the fact that there are several studies or researches on energy as well as ecological economics which should have measured what precisely ‘carbon footprint’. Normally the carbon footprint will be calculated number of people residing in specific region will be average with the number of People in that specific region. A system is being proposed to calculate the exact emissions from homes and industries separately. This approach aims to improve the precision of carbon footprint calculations and enable more targeted efforts to reduce emissions. The existing system has some drawback in calculation which will be eventually average for each footprint in region. A calculation method is being developed to predict accurate results for each carbon emissions outcome. This approach aims to improve the precision of carbon footprint calculations and enable more targeted efforts to reduce emissions.</p>
