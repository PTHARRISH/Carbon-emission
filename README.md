<h2 align='center'>Abstract</h2>
<p align='justify'>In the last couple of years, the expression ‘carbon footprint’ has been in use among meteorologist. The usage of the expression is not unconnected with the fact that the challenge of climate change has been one of the topmost issues on political as well as corporate agenda. Therefore, calculations of carbon footprint have been in high demand. Scholars have proposed so many approaches to providing estimates. The methods run from uncomplicated online calculations to other ones like complex life-cycle examination otherwise called input-output-based technique and tools. In spite of its ever-present use, it is clear that the term ‘carbon footprint’ does not have a generally acceptable academic definition. Thus, there is a dearth of clarifications of what ‘carbon footprint’ is in the scientific literature despite the fact that there are several studies or researches on energy as well as ecological economics which should have measured what precisely ‘carbon footprint’. Normally the carbon footprint will be calculated number of people residing in specific region will be average with the number of People in that specific region. A system is being proposed to calculate the exact emissions from homes and industries separately. This approach aims to improve the precision of carbon footprint calculations and enable more targeted efforts to reduce emissions. The existing system has some drawback in calculation which will be eventually average for each footprint in region. A calculation method is being developed to predict accurate results for each carbon emissions outcome. This approach aims to improve the precision of carbon footprint calculations and enable more targeted efforts to reduce emissions.</p>

<h2 align='center'>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<h3 align='left'>1.1	About the Project</h3>
<p align='justify'>Over the past two years, the term "carbon footprint" has been used by meteorologists. The use of this phrase is not unrelated to the fact that the challenge of climate change is one of the key issues on the political and business agenda. Therefore, calculating carbon emissions has been in high demand. Researchers have come up with a variety of approaches to providing estimates. Methods range from simple online calculations to others such as complex lifecycle testing aka input-output-based techniques and tools. Despite common usage, it is clear that the term "carbon footprint" does not have a widely accepted academic definition. Therefore, there is a lack of clear explanation of what a “carbon footprint” is in the scientific literature despite the fact that there are several studies or studies on energy as well as ecological economics that should have measured it. What exactly is a “carbon footprint”? Normally carbon emissions will be calculated. The number of people residing in a particular area will average with the number of people in that particular area. A system is being developed to calculate the exact emissions of households and industries separately, which will provide a more accurate picture of the sources of carbon emissions. This approach aims to improve the precision of carbon footprint calculations and enable more targeted efforts to reduce emissions. The current system has a certain drawback in the calculation which will eventually be the average per footprint in the area. A calculation method that predicts the precise outcome for each specific outcome is being considered to improve the accuracy of carbon emissions calculations. Additionally, there are proposals for reusing carbon emissions in various ways that offer utility.</p>

<h3 align='left'>1.3	 Module Description</h3>
<p align='justify'>Module</p>
<p align='left'>•	Home Emission</p>
<p align='left'>•	Industry Emission</p>
<p align='left'>•	Data Analyst</p>
<p align='left'>•	Admin</p>

<h3 align='left'>Home Emission</h3>
<p align='justify'>In this module, the carbon footprint for a home in a specific region can be estimated. The region can be an industrial area, regional area, or well-developed area. Carbon footprint is averaged equally among individuals. For example, on a flight, the fuel burned to travel 10 kilometers will be averaged out among all passengers. The module consists of sub-modules that can be navigated, including user details, emission calculation, updating user details, displaying results of the calculated emission, and logging out. Users can update their details such as their name, type of house, and number of occupants, and these details will be used to calculate their carbon emissions. The emission calculation tab will require inputs for diesel, petrol, gas, electricity, and the usage of trains, taxis, and buses. The back-end code is already written to calculate emissions based on the liters of fuel used and the mode of transportation. Users can edit and update their submitted details, and the final output will be transferred to the admin for approval before being processed by a data analyst. The data analyst will check the inputs and compare them to predicted data before sending the results back to the admin. These are the functions of the module.</p>

<h3 align='left'>Industry Emission</h3>
<p align='justify'>In this module, emissions from industries in a specific region can be estimated. It is important to accurately account for industrial emissions as it is a significant contributor to carbon footprint calculations. The module includes sub-modules such as Industry details, emission calculations, result of emissions, update industry details, and log out. On the industry home page, users can provide input for the emission calculation based on their fuel and coal consumption. Back-end functions have been developed to accurately calculate carbon footprint based on this information. Users can also update their information using the update function, and this updated information will be used in the calculation of their carbon emissions. The calculated emissions can then be transferred to the admin team for approval before being processed by the data analyst. The data analyst will manually check the input from the admin and evaluate the calculation output before sending it back to the admin. By accurately accounting for industrial emissions, it can be better to understand the carbon footprint of a specific region and take steps to prevent further damage to the environment. </p>

<h3 align='left'>Data Analyst</h3>
<p align='justify'>Data processing plays a critical role in accurately estimating the carbon footprint of homes and industries. The backend functions and calculations have been written to calculate the emissions from petrol, diesel, gas, and electricity. For instance, petrol emissions are calculated by multiplying the number of liters used by 2.33, diesel emissions by 2.68, gas emissions by 2.68, and electricity emissions by the number of kilowatt-hours used multiplied by 0.90. The module includes sub-modules such as view home and industry emissions, and calculations are processed using the trained data stored in the database. The admin team receives requests from homeowners and industries, which are then sent to data analysts for verification and processing. The analysts compare the estimated emissions to the dataset to ensure accuracy. This process is crucial in accurately estimating the carbon footprint of homes and industries and developing effective strategies to mitigate environmental damage.</p>

<h3 align='left'>Admin</h3>
<p align='justify'>The admin module is an essential part of the process and involves high level management. Admin personnel have the authority to access the data for both home and industry emissions, and only admin can log in to the admin module. Admin functions include viewing home and industry emissions, calculating emissions, approving requests from clients, and reviewing the calculation output. The admin can also view the output of calculations. The process of the admin involves approving the input from home and industry emissions, which is then sent to the data process.  Once entered into the data process, analysis begins, and the input is compared to the trained data, utilizing algorithms. The same process is repeated for industry emissions.</p>
